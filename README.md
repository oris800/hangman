## Setup & How to Run üöÄ

### 1. File Structure

Place the game files in the same directory. You will also need to create your own word list file.

```
hangman_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game_logic.py   # The file containing the Game class
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py         # The main script to run the game
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ words.txt       # An example word list file you create
```

### 2. Create a Word List

Create a file named `words.txt` (or any other name ending with `.txt`). Add words or phrases to it, with each one on a new line. The game automatically handles spaces by converting them to hyphens (`-`).

**Example `words.txt` content:**

```
python programming
visual studio code
artificial intelligence
open source
```

### 3. Run the Game

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `hangman_project` directory, and run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play üéÆ

1.  **Start the Game**: Run `main.py` from your terminal.
2.  **Select Word List**: You'll be asked if you want to use the GUI file manager.
    * Enter `Y` to open a window where you can browse and select your `.txt` file.
    * Enter `N` to type the file path directly into the terminal.
3.  **Guess a Letter**: The game will display the hidden word as underscores (`_`). Enter a single letter and press `Enter`.
4.  **Game Progress**:
    * If the letter is **correct**, it will be revealed in the word.
    * If the letter is **incorrect**, you will lose a try, and another part of the hangman will be drawn.
5.  **Win or Lose**:
    * You **win** by guessing all the letters in the word before running out of tries.
    * You **lose** if the full hangman is drawn.
6.  **Play Again**: After the game ends, you can choose to play another round with the same list or a new one.
